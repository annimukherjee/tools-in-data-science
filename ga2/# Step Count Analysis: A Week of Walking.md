# Step Count Analysis: A Week of Walking

## Introduction

This document provides an **imaginary** analysis of the number of steps walked each day over a week, comparing individual trends over time and with friends. The goal is to identify patterns, encourage a healthier lifestyle, and add a fun, competitive element to daily step tracking.

## Methodology

### Data Collection

- Each participant recorded their daily step count using a fitness tracker.
- Data was collected for **seven consecutive days**.
- Steps were compared against personal trends and friends' step counts.

### Data Processing

The collected data was analyzed using Python. Below is a sample script that was used to process the step count data:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Sample Data: Steps taken each day
steps_data = {
    "Day": ["Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday", "Sunday"],
    "Steps": [8500, 9200, 8800, 9400, 11000, 12000, 15000]
}

df = pd.DataFrame(steps_data)
print(df.describe())  # Display summary statistics
```


### Results and Discussion
Weekly Step Count Overview
Below is a table summarizing the total steps walked by two participants over the week:

Day	My Steps	Friend's Steps
Monday	8,500	9,200
Tuesday	9,200	10,500
Wednesday	8,800	8,600
Thursday	9,400	9,700
Friday	11,000	11,500
Saturday	12,000	12,300
Sunday	15,000	14,800
Observations
Peak Activity: The highest step count was recorded on Sunday, indicating increased activity on weekends.
Midweek Dip: A slight decline in steps was observed midweek.
Competition Factor: A comparison with a friend’s steps suggests that friendly competition can be a motivator.
Conclusion
This analysis highlights how tracking step counts can reveal patterns in activity levels. It encourages setting achievable goals and leveraging social motivation.
